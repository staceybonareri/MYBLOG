    <h1>WELCOME TO MY SILLY WORLD</h1>
    <h2>Hello Humans</h2>
    <p> let's kick it people. Today's discussion is centered on feminism. The word that is used haphazardly by those who fail to understand and appreciate the meaning of this term. If you are with me then thirst for knowledge is your thing then lets decipher what it is to be a feminist. Feminism is dated to the early 1960,s or 70,s who is keeping up with history. it was the first time women were allowed to vote in the United States of America. The movement was advanced by a group of women known as the suffrogates. In that point in time women were not acknowledge in social status. The notion advanced by younglings that dont understand the history is that men are trash. arguably true however, society has always been patriachal but its the views held by patriachs about women that i have an issue with. Roxanne Gay states that she is a radical femeinist understanding that women rights are vital but also that in this current generation, feminism is intersectional. </p>
